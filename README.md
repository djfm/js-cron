# A very basic CRON-like tool in TS/JS that allows:
- scheduling unlimited amount of daily tasks at specific times
- sends reports via e-mail, whether the jobs have succeeded or not, for cheap monitoring

Why reinvent the wheel?

Cuz I always stuble upon weird issues with CRON on servers, and this covers like 95% of my needs.
